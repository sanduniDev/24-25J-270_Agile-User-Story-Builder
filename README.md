## Overview of the Component 3

The Collaborative Agile Dashboard is an intelligent project management tool designed to enhance Agile workflows by integrating real-time feedback analysis and data-driven time-budget predictions. This system leverages machine learning models, including Random Forest algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, ensuring accurate estimations and improved decision-making in Agile teams.

One of its key features is experience-based timeline prediction, which dynamically adjusts time estimations based on team expertise levels, ensuring adaptability to varying team compositions. The dashboard also incorporates real-time sentiment analysis, allowing feedback loops to refine project timelines and priorities. By analyzing historical project data and team dynamics, the system optimizes budget allocation and minimizes the risk of delays or misallocations.

The platform provides interactive visualization tools, offering Agile teams an intuitive way to manage user stories, track project progress, and prioritize tasks. Seamless integration with Azure Speech-to-Text enables voice-based user story creation, streamlining requirement documentation.

The dashboard is built using Python for machine learning, Scikit-Learn for predictive modeling, and React or Angular for the frontend interface. It supports integration with popular Agile tools like JIRA, GitHub, and Azure DevOps, enhancing collaboration and workflow efficiency.

By combining advanced AI-driven predictions with Agile best practices, the Collaborative Agile Dashboard empowers development teams with precise estimations, real-time insights, and improved project adaptability, ultimately driving efficiency and success in software development lifecycle management.
