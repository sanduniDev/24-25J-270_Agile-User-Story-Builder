Good morning everyone! Thank you for joining us today. We're excited about the potential of this mobile application for our students. 

You start by giving us an overview page of this project, Professor Jones. We're thrilled to be working on it and ensuring our students understand the testing application. 

It sounds good, but we have main concerns ensuring that our students have easy access to the post details and schedules. This plan aims to address these concerns.

Through these interviews, we want to understand the needs and preferences of our students. We will frame prototypes before finalizing the features. 

Additionally, we need to ensure that the interview today covers existing systems, such as student information systems. Please tell us more about how you handle integration, as it is crucial for success.

To understand payments and existing infrastructure, developers must ensure that our systems are secure and efficient. Two major concerns have been raised, especially since pollution affects students.

Furthermore, we need to secure students' data from human intrusion. Additionally, we should address issues like autism, ensuring that we find ways to help affected individuals. 

What about the timeline? When do you expect to be ready for launch? Discussions indicate that the project will take about six months from start to finish. This includes the research and development phase.

During this time, we will test the project to ensure it is on track. We are looking forward to seeing this project come to life. 

Good questions for us! The specific features and functionality are central to this. 

We would like to include features such as push notifications for updates, a calendar for schedules, and a feedback system for students. 

Additionally, from a non-technical perspective, we should consider different types of information such as post details, schedules, and announcements. 

We want to ensure that students can find these easily and that the system is visually appealing. The visual appeal is essential, including the use of university colors. 

Itâ€™s important that the navigation is user-friendly, and the interface is inviting. 

We aim to create a system that reflects the quality of the university. 

Today, we are excited to get started on this project. Thank you! Let's make this a successful venture.
