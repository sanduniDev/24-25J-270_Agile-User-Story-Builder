**Feature Brainstorming: Simplifying Onboarding**

**Product Manager:** Thanks for joining. Today’s focus is on simplifying user onboarding.

**UX Designer:** Let’s create an interactive walkthrough for first-time users.

**Developer:** We can also use tooltips that explain features as users navigate.

**Tester:** Don’t forget to test for different levels of tech-savviness. Some users might need more guidance.

**Product Manager:** Great points. Let’s also include a feedback button during onboarding so users can report issues.

**UX Designer:** I’ll design a prototype for review next week.

**All:** Looking forward to it!
